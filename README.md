# üìò Project Scope Document: PrivexBot

## üîñ Project Name

**PrivexBot ‚Äî Privacy-First AI Chatbot Builder Powered by Secret VM**

---

## üìå Overview

**PrivexBot** is a privacy-focused, secure chatbot builder platform that empowers organizations to build and deploy AI-powered chatbots trained on their own data. Unlike traditional platforms, all AI workloads‚Äîincluding training, inference, and data ingestion‚Äîare executed within **Secret Network‚Äôs Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)** using **Secret VMs**, ensuring **confidential computation**, **compliance**, and **zero data leakage**.

PrivexBot enables multi-platform chatbot deployment via embeddable widgets, Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, Slack, or even custom-hosted URLs. Teams, enterprises, and agencies can easily create, manage, and distribute custom AI assistants (powered by  **Secret AI LLM**) with full control over data, plugins, and workflow logic.

## üöÄ Project Goals

* Build a **scalable, multi-tenant chatbot builder** with per-org workspaces
* Provide a **drag-and-drop chatbot builder** with real-time preview and plugin support
* Run **100% of AI computation inside Secret VMs** for security and compliance
* Offer a **plugin marketplace** for extensibility (e.g., web scrapers, Text to audio converter, Secret AI LLM Model, CRM tools, custom actions)
* Enable **agency tooling** for managing and reselling bots to clients
* Support **knowledge source ingestion** from Notion, Google Docs, websites, PDFs, CSVs, etc.
* Allow **deployment across multiple platforms** (Web, Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, Zapier, etc)
* Include **analytics, billing, access control**, and team collaboration tools

## üîê Why Secret VMs and Trusted Infrastructure Matter

PrivexBot is not just another chatbot builder. It‚Äôs designed for a **privacy-first future**. Here‚Äôs why building on **Secret VMs** makes a difference:

### Advantages of Secret VMs

* **End-to-End Confidentiality:** All chatbot data, user prompts, and LLM responses stay encrypted in memory during compute.
* **Remote Attestation:** Cryptographically prove that code and data weren‚Äôt tampered with during inference.
* **Zero Trust Architecture:** Privexbot ensures that user data is protected from tampering during execution.
* **Regulatory Compliance:** Meet enterprise-grade standards such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)

By running all inference and processing in Secret VMs, PrivexBot becomes the **most secure** way to deploy an AI chatbot.

## üìÇ System Architecture & Folder Structure

### Microservice-Based Architecture

PrivexBot will follow a modular, scalable architecture separating concerns into services:

```
privexbot/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/           # Next.js or React UI for dashboard & builder
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/            # API logic (auth, orgs, billing, chat logs)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ai-services/        # LLM orchestration, vector embeddings (in Secret VMs)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gateway/            # Secure routing layer to VMs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plugins/            # Dynamic plugin loader & registry
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ worker/             # Background jobs (ingestion, syncing, email)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ infra/              # Terraform, deployment configs
```
[Click here for detailed architecture](./architecture-guide.md#project-structure)

### Why This Architecture?

* **Separation of concerns:** Clear division between UI, AI logic, plugins, and core backend
* **Scalability:** Each service can scale independently
* **Security:** AI runs in isolated Secret VMs
* **Dev agility:** Teams can extend plugins or UI without touching core backend
